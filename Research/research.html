            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Creating a website is not a easy task. We cannot create or develop anything without
            having the idea of what we are looking for or what our design needs to be attractive.
            So before performing any tasks we need to do research on the subject for the better outcome 
            or result. Without research the outcome will not be that good as compared to the product
            that is refined through proper research and goood development. So, for creating this websiite i also did various research
            different website Some of the resources that i looked for during my research are given below
            with he improvement or implementation in my own website.<br><br>

             which i find very interesting so i took this design as an inspiration to create my own homepage below is link for the design
             i took reference form and also the screenshot of my own homepage. <br> <br>
