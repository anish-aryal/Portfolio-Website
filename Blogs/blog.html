            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Every aspect of our daily lives has changed significantly with technology. With technology we can do many things. 
            In future we can think nothing about technology because, for a modern life, we have a lot of technical stuff. 
            It will change in the future, because there is nothing new in the future and now, in our lives, we have all to do. Therefore, 
            through training, communication and medical treatment technology have greatly improved our lives.Technology helps us to maintain 
            contact with those who are not. We can talk to them and even see them on phones and computers. Our everyday work in the office 
            is also based on technology. People are no longer using the pen and paper for their work. Through gyms we keep our health. 
            There are in the fitness center machines that help us weigh down and maintain fitness. Our life has been comfortable through 
            using technology. A life without technology cannot be considered. We can maintain a great deal of information in a small 
            device and use it if we like. The usage of technology has also improved cars. Technology is therefore an undeniable element of our lives.
            The fact that technology is undisputedly important on our daily basis has inspired scientists to improve their invented tools 
            and devices from time to time for the users to use, just to make our lives easier. We tend to always take a step forward. 
            Not only the present, but also the future can help technology. The potential profit or losses can be calculated. On the 
            basis of this, we can create plans and a list of precautionary steps for our descendants' future.<br><br>

            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; First of all, for several reasons, technological developments are beneficial to humans. Technology can help treat more 
            diseased people on a medical level and thus save many lives and combat highly damaging viruses and bacteria. An important
             point was the invention of the computer. This improves communication and allows companies to communicate with foreign 
             countries more easily. Research is simplified, too.The productivity of almost every industry in the world has also been 
             increased by the technology. Thanks to technology, instead of using banks, we can even pay with bitcoins. New things are 
             discovered every day after closer observation. Take, for example, radio broadcasting nearly immediately followed when 
             radio waves were discovered. The same goes for TV and electricity. Had no one found it possible to generate electricity, 
             the entertainment industries would not be at this stage of development.<br> 
             &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Technology improves everyday life and allows physical storage devices to be moved into virtual storage banks. Through 
             technology, scientists of the time can also send astronauts into the moon. Machines carry out the greatest amount of farming 
             and industrial work in the modern industrial world and therefore employees produce much more goods than they were a century 
             ago and work less. They can work in safer surroundings more time and exercise.Technology has a significant impact on human lifestyles. 
             It is constantly evolving, improving, and providing new ideas to people in order to improve their lives. Today's world 
             lifestyle is vastly different from that of 20 years ago. If people from the past visit today's technological world, 
             they will be astounded by the new technological inventions. People are constantly exposed to new ideas and lifestyles 
             as a result of technological advancements. People create new inventions in order to live a better life.

        <h3 class="disadvantage">Disdvantages of Technology</h3>
        <!-- to write another pargraph -->
        <p class="par" style="position: absolute; margin-left: 192px; top: 1620px; width: 1081px;"> 
           &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; On the other hand, the evolution of modern technology has drawbacks, such as reliance on new technology. Man is no longer 
            required to think. Even if the calculator is a useful invention, man no longer performs mental calculations or exercises 
            his memory. Human capital decline implies an increase in unemployment. Devices can, in some cases, replace the human mind.
            The use of technology undoubtedly needs rules and new laws. Use of the internet, for example, is an example of individual 
            liberty. However, the invention of the atomic bomb cannot be considered an act of individual liberty. In fact, regulations 
            are difficult to implement when these technologies are introduced, such as the regulation surrounding the impending arrival 
            of autonomous vehicles. Finally, because most technological breakthroughs aim to reduce human effort, it would imply that 
            machines do more work. This translates to less work for people: the human is becoming increasingly obsolete as processes are 
            automated and jobs become obsolete. <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; One of the worst aspects of modern technology is that it reduces people's creativity. As I previously stated, modern technology 
            is the most distracting thing today. People are constantly occupied with modern technological gadgets, which limits their creativity. 
            Creativity is something like discovering new, interesting, and one-of-a-kind ideas in everything and putting them into action, and 
            these creative ideas come from deep thought.However, through the use of technology, they distract their minds by using only modern technological gadgets. 
            As a result, they are bound to lose their inventiveness.

            &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; The preceding discussion is about the benefits and drawbacks of modern technology on society's youth. 
            After reading this article, I hope you have a better understanding of why I wrote it. Actually, I am attempting to 
            educate people on both the benefits and drawbacks of technology. And to make people aware of how they are using technology. 
            Everything is dependent on how people use technology. If they misuse technology, the outcome will be disastrous for them. 
            And if they are using technology to its limits and are aware of the negative effects of technology on them, that will be beneficial to them.
            Technology has a significant impact on life. There is no specific effect on life; it is dependent on how the technology is used. 
            When we use technology in a destructive manner, we are endangering human life. And if we use it for the benefit of people, 
            it can be a boon to humanity. Technology, in my opinion, is an infinite field of creations and inventions.
